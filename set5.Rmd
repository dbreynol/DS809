# Bayesian Inference 

## Bayesian logic

In the Bayesian paradigm, parameters ($\theta$) are random and data ($y$) are fixed. Inference is carried out through the posterior distribution of parameters given data.

$$p(\theta \vert y) = \frac{p(y|\theta) p(\theta)}{p(y)}$$
For very simple models, we can write the analytical solution for the posterior. For example, suppose we are flipping a coin and we are interested in learning about the parameter $\theta = P(\text{Heads})$. 

Before observing any data, we believe that $\theta$ is probably around 0.5 but we are not sure. We can encode this belief with a prior distribution whose expected value is 0.5 and ranges from 0 to 1. A good choice is the [Beta distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution). In particular, we can use a Beta($\alpha = 2$, $\beta = 2$),

\begin{align}
p(\theta) = 6\theta (1-\theta).
\end{align}

Now we generate some data. We flip the coin (independently) 7 times and observe 5 heads. Since our data is a sequence of 0s and 1s, we can use the binomial distribution for the likelihood. That is:

\begin{align}
p(y_1, \ldots y_7 \vert \theta) &= {7 \choose 5}  \theta^5 (1-\theta)^2.
\end{align}

Now we can multiply them together to get the posterior distribution of $\theta$:

\begin{align}
p(\theta \vert y) &= \frac{p(y|\theta) p(\theta)}{p(y)} \\
&= \theta^5 (1-\theta)^2 \times \theta (1-\theta) \times 6/p(y) \\
&= \theta^6 (1-\theta)^3 \times 6/p(y) \\
&= \text{Beta}(7,4)
\end{align}

```{r}
x = seq(0,1, by = 0.01)
y = dbeta(x, 2, 2)
y2 = dbeta(x, 7, 4)
plot(x,y, type = "l", col = "blue", ylim = c(0,3),
     main = "Prior (blue) and Posterior (red)")
lines(x, y2, col = "red")
```

## Monte Carlo Idea

Suppose we can sample from $p(\theta \vert \text{data})$. Then we could generate,

\begin{align}
\theta^{1},\ldots,\theta^{S} \sim p(\theta | \text{data})
\end{align}

and obtain Monte Carlo approximations of posterior quantities:

\begin{align}
E(g(\theta) \vert \text{data}) \approx \frac{1}{S} \sum_{i=1}^S g(\theta^i).
\end{align}

But what if you can't sample from $p(\theta \vert \text{data})$?

## Metropolis Algorithm

The metropolis algorithm proceeds as follows:

1. Sample $\theta^{\star} \sim J(\theta \vert \theta^{s})$, where $J$ is called the *proposal distribution*. For the Metropolis Algorithm, we assume that this distribution is symmetric. 

2. Compute the acceptance ratio, $r$:


$$r = \frac{p(\theta^\star \vert \text{data})}{p(\theta^{s} \vert \text{data})}$$
3 Let

\begin{equation}
  \theta^{s+1} =
    \begin{cases}
      \theta^{\star} & \text{with prob min}(r,1) \\
      \theta^{s} & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}       
\end{equation}


Step 3 can be accomplished by sampling $u \sim \text{Unif}(0,1)$ and setting $\theta^{s+1} = \theta^\star$ if $u < r$ and setting $\theta^{s+1} = \theta^s$ otherwise.

## Example

Let's consider a multivariate linear regression model. That is, we will model our response variable, $y$, as

\begin{align}
y = X\beta + \epsilon.
\end{align}

For simplicity, let us assume that $\epsilon \sim N(0,1)$. Therefore, the parameter that we want to do inference on is $\beta$. So, we want to sample from $p(\beta \vert y)$.To do so, we need two ingredients, a likelihood function and a prior distribution for $\beta$, $p(\beta)$.

\begin{align}
p(\beta \vert y) &\propto p(y \vert \beta) p(\beta) \\
&= \text{likelihood} \times \text{prior}
\end{align}

For the linear regression model, our likelihood function can be written as,

\begin{align}
p(y \vert \beta) = (2\pi \sigma)^{-n/2} \exp{\bigg( -\frac{1}{2 \sigma^2} (y - X \beta)^T (y - X \beta) \bigg)}.
\end{align}

For the prior, we will assum that we know nothing about $\beta$. So, we will use the prior distribution,

\begin{align}
p( \beta) \propto 1.
\end{align}

We will use the proposal distribution,

\begin{align}
J(\theta^{\star} \vert \theta) \sim N(\theta, cI)
\end{align}.

Let us start by sampling some data that follows this model.

```{r echo=TRUE}
set.seed(1)
n = 100
X = matrix( data = c(rep(1,n), rnorm(n) ), ncol = 2)
beta_true = c(1,2)
y = rnorm(100, mean = X %*% beta_true, sd = 1)
```

Now let's implement the MH algorithm and sample from the posterior distribution of $\beta$. Our MCMC output for the slope coefficient, $\beta_1$, is summarized below.

```{r echo=TRUE}
nIter = 1e5
betas = matrix(0, nrow = nIter, ncol = 2)

beta_current = betas[1,]
p_current = exp ( -1/2 * t(y - X %*% betas[1,]) %*% (y- X %*% betas[1,] ))

for(j in 2:nIter) {
  # propose a new value for betas
  beta_prop = rnorm( 2, mean = betas[(j-1),], sd = .2)
  
  # compute probability of data | beta proposed
  p_prop = exp ( -1/2 * t(y - X %*% beta_prop) %*% (y- X %*% beta_prop ))
  
  r = p_prop/p_current
  
  if ( r > 1 ) {
    beta_current = beta_prop
    p_current = p_prop
    
  } else if (runif(1) < r) {
    beta_current = beta_prop
    p_current = p_prop
  }
  
  betas[j, ] = beta_current
  
}
```

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(100:nIter, betas[100:nIter,2], col = "blue", main = TeX("$\\beta_1$ Trace Plot"), cex = 0.01)
hist(betas[100:nIter,2], main = TeX("Samples from $\\beta_1$"))
```

## Dynamic Regression

Let's look at this concept at work with a dynamic regression model. We will use the `Seatbelts` dataset and fit a model using `y=DriversKilled` and `x = PetrolPrice`. 

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(Seatbelts[,1], main = "Drivers Killed")
plot(Seatbelts[,6], main = "Petrol Price")
```


The model we will fit is:

\begin{align}
y_t &= \mu_t + \beta_t x_t + \epsilon_t \\
\mu_t &= \mu_{t-1} + \eta_t \\
\beta_t &= \beta_{t-1} + \tau_t 
\end{align}


```{r echo=TRUE}
y = Seatbelts[,1] # drivers killed
x = Seatbelts[,6] # petrol price

# fit the model
ss = list()
ss = AddLocalLevel(ss, y)
ss = AddSeasonal(ss, y, nseasons = 12)
ss = AddDynamicRegression(ss, y ~ x)
dynmodel <- bsts(y,
               state.specification = ss,
               niter = 1000)

PlotBstsComponents(dynmodel)
# dynmodel$dynamic.regression.coefficients
```

A relevant question is whether this model improves performance as compared with the simpler model:

\begin{align}
y_t &= \mu_t + \beta x_t + \epsilon_t \\
\mu_t &= \mu_{t-1} + \eta_t.
\end{align}

To address this, we can fit the simpler model and compare the cumulative error of the two models.

```{r echo=TRUE}
ss2 = list()
ss2 = AddLocalLevel(ss2, y)
ss = AddSeasonal(ss2, y, nseasons = 12)
fixedmodel <- bsts(y ~ x,
               state.specification = ss2,
               niter = 1000)

CompareBstsModels(list("fixed coef" = fixedmodel, "dynamic" = dynmodel))
```


## Stochastic Volatility Model

A stochastic volatility model is a special case of a state space model. The simplest version is:

\begin{align}
y_t &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 y_{t-1} + \exp(h_t/2) \epsilon_t \\
h_t &= \mu + \phi(h_{t-1} - \mu) + \sigma \eta_t
\end{align}

where $\epsilon \sim N(0,1)$ and $\eta_t \sim N(0,1)$.

```{r echo=TRUE}
set.seed(1)
data("exrates")
ind = which(exrates$date >= as.Date("2011-03-01") & exrates$date <= as.Date("2012-03-01"))
CHF_price <- exrates$CHF[ind]
res_sv <- svsample(CHF_price, designmatrix = "ar1")
plot(res_sv)
```

## Lab 6

1. Adjust the MH algorithm in [Example] by including an informative prior for $\beta$. In particular, use 

\begin{align}
p(\beta) \sim N(\mathbf{0}, \frac{1}{\lambda} I),
\end{align}

where $I$ is a $2 \times 2$ identity matrix and $\mathbf{0}$ is a vector with two elements. Use the same simulated data as in the example. Run the algorithm for three different $\lambda$ values (10, 50, 100). For each of the three $\lambda$ values, make a trace plot and a histogram for $\beta_1$.

```{r eval = F}
nIter = 1e5
betas = matrix(0, nrow = nIter, ncol = 2)
lam = 100
beta_current = betas[1,]
p_current = exp ( -1/2 * t(y - X %*% betas[1,]) %*% (y- X %*% betas[1,] ) - lam/2 * t(betas[1,]) %*% betas[1,]  )

for(j in 2:nIter) {
  # propose a new value for betas
  beta_prop = rnorm( 2, mean = betas[(j-1),], sd = .2)
  
  # compute probability of data | beta proposed
  p_prop = exp ( -1/2 * t(y - X %*% beta_prop) %*% (y- X %*% beta_prop ) - lam/2 * t(beta_prop) %*% beta_prop)
  
  r = p_prop/p_current
  
  if ( r > 1 ) {
    beta_current = beta_prop
    p_current = p_prop
    
  } else if (runif(1) < r) {
    beta_current = beta_prop
    p_current = p_prop
  }
  
  betas[j, ] = beta_current
  
}

hist(betas[,2])
```

2. Fit a dynamic regression model to the livestock data used in Lab 5. Compare with the state space model fit in question 5 of lab 5 using `CompareBstsModels`. Based on this plot, which model fits the data better?

3. Suppose you have data that is generated from a Normal distribution. That is, 

$$y_1, \ldots, y_n \sim \text{Normal}(\mu, \sigma^2)$$.

You are interested in doing (Bayesian) inference on $\mu$. You decide to use a normal prior distribution for $\mu$,

$$p(\mu) \sim \text{Normal}(\mu_0, \tau^2)$$.

The posterior distribution, $p(\mu \vert y_1, \ldots, y_n )$ is also Normal. What are the mean and variance of the posterior distribution for $\mu$?
