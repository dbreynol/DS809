# ARIMA Models

## AR Models

An _autoregressive_ model of order _p_, or AR(_p_), is defined as

$$
x_t = \phi_0 + \phi_1 x_{t-1} + \phi_2 x_{t-2} + \dots + \phi_p x_{t-p} + w_t
$$

where we assume

1. $w_t$ is white noise. That is, $w_t \sim N(0,\sigma^2_w)$.

2. $\phi_p \neq 0$ for an order-_p_ process

### AR(1) Model

Let's start by figuring out some properties of the simplest AR model, the AR(1) model:

$$
x_t = \phi_0 + \phi_1 x_{t-1} + w_t
$$

We start by assuming that $x_t$ is a stationary time series. Under this assumption, we can show:

\begin{align}
E(x_t) &= \frac{\phi_0}{1-\phi_1} \\
Var(x_t) &= \frac{\sigma^2_w}{1-\phi_1^2} \\
\rho(h) &= \phi_1^h
\end{align}

For this to work, $|\phi_1| < 1$. Now let's simulate some data from an AR1 model and compare theoretical and observed quantities.

```{r echo=TRUE}
set.seed(1)
phi_1 = 0.5
sigsq_w = 1
x = arima.sim(n = 10000, model = list(ar=c(phi_1)), sd = sigsq_w)
```

```{r}


theory = c(0, 1.333333, 1)

```
