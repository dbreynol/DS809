Time series data creates unique problems for statistical modeling and inference. Traditional inference assumes that observations (data) are independent and identically distributed. Adjacent data points in time series data are not necessarily independent (uncorrelated). Most time series models aim to exploit such dependence. For instance, yesterday’s demand of a product may tell us something about today’s demand of a product. There are several different ways to represent time series data in R. We will use the tidyverse family of packages extensively in this class. This package includes the lubridate package, which includes functions to work with date-times. Two of the most common ways to represent time series data are using data frames in which one of the variables is a time object (such as POSIXct or Date) or using a time series object. 2.2 Time Series EDA The first thing to do in any data analysis is exploratory data analysis (EDA). Graphs enable many features of the data to be visualized, including patterns, unusual observations, changes over time, and relationships between variables. The features that are seen in plots of the data can then be incorporated into statistical models. R has several systems for making graphs. We will primarily use ggplot2, which is among the set of tidyverse packages and is one of the most versatile systems for plotting. We will use a data set from Kayak to motivate our analysis. conversions = read.csv(&quot;data/conversions.csv&quot;) #read.csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dbreynol/DS809/main/data/conversions.csv&quot;) knitr::kable(head(conversions)) datestamp country_code marketing_channel conversions 2014-11-01 be Display Ads 1174 2014-11-01 be KAYAK Deals Email 57 2014-11-01 be Search Engine Ads 1122 2014-11-01 be Search Engine Results 976 2014-11-01 fi Display Ads 12 2014-11-01 fi Search Engine Results 2 This dataset contains information on the total number of daily conversions by country and marketing channel. Let us focus our analysis on the US and first visualize the number of conversions by day. This plot contains a lot of useful information. To gain insight into how conversions depend on marketing channel, we can use facets. Facets are subplots that display a time series for each marketing channel. Display ads and search engine ads are the dominant marketing channels. Both have a regular pattern that is likely a function of the day of week, with a higher number of conversions during weekdays as compared with weekends. We can explore this feature by aggregating over each weekday and visualizing how the distribution of conversions changes by day. Clearly, there are significant changes in the mean level of conversions across the week. This is a form of seasonality. It may be useful to see what the data look like when this weekday effect is removed. To do so, we could visualize the residuals from the following linear regression model: \\[\\begin{align} \\hat{\\text{conversions}} = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^6 \\bigg( \\hat{\\beta}_j \\times \\mathbb{1}(\\text{weekday = j}) \\bigg), \\end{align}\\] where \\(j\\) indexes the day of week. The indicator function in this case acts as a logical switch where, \\[\\begin{align} \\mathbb{1}(\\text{weekday} = j) = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{if } \\text{weekday} = j \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise.} \\end{cases} \\end{align}\\] The residuals from this model consist of each observation minus the mean for that particular weekday. This allows us to more clearly see the trend across the date range, removing the effect of the weekly pattern. 2.3 Noise Processes Noise processes (white noise, random walk, AR, MA) are important in time-series work because they are the practical language for describing, diagnosing, and modeling uncertainty over time. These are the building blocks of nearly all time series models. Time series data always mix: Signal: trends, seasonality, persistence, cycles Noise: random shocks, measurement error, unmodeled behavior Noise offers a precise way of measuring: How much of today depends on yesterday (AR) How shocks propagate over time (MA) How quickly randomness dies out. 2.3.1 White noise White noise is a particularly important building block becuase when a time series is white noise, then there is no predictable structure. That is, a white noise time series will not yield to any amount of forecasting prowess. Let \\(w_t\\) be a random variable indexed by time, \\(t \\in [1,T]\\). The following properties characterize white noise: \\[\\begin{align} \\mathbb{E}(w_t) &amp;= 0 \\\\ \\operatorname{Var}(w_t) &amp;= \\sigma^2 \\\\ \\operatorname{Cov}(w_t, w_s) &amp;= 0 \\text{ } \\forall \\text{ } t,s \\end{align}\\] Note that Gaussian white noise is a special case where \\(w_t \\sim N(o, \\sigma^2)\\). White noise can come in different flavors. In the right hand plot below, \\(w_t = 2e_t - 1\\), where \\(e_t \\sim \\text{Bernoulli(.5)}\\). In the left plot, \\(w_t \\sim N(0,2)\\). 2.3.2 Random Walk Let us consider another simple model to describe time series data, \\(y_t = y_{t-1}+w_t\\), where \\(w_t \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\) and all elements of the error vector are mutually independent. This is the random walk model. The random walk is fundamental because it is the simplest model where the past fully determines the present level, yet provides no information about the future—making it the natural benchmark (or, null model) in time-series analysis. When a time series follows a random walk, one can estimate the distribution of changes from one time step to the next but not the level of the time series beyond one time step. Let’s derive some important properties of this model: What is the mean, \\(\\mathbb{E}(y_t)\\)? What is the variance, \\(\\operatorname{Var}(y_t)\\)? 2.3.3 AR Process A slightly more general model is the autoregressive (AR) model, in which \\(y_t\\) is a linear combination of its past \\(p\\) values plus gaussian white noise, \\(w_t\\). That is, \\[\\begin{align} y_t = \\sum_{i=1}^p \\phi_i y_{t-i} + w_t. \\end{align}\\] This model quantifies how much of today depends on yesterday (and the day before, etc.). 2.3.4 Exercise Consider the AR(1) process with a drift: \\[\\begin{align} y_t &amp;= a + \\phi y_{t-1} + w_t \\end{align}\\] Write \\(y_t\\) as a function of past white noise values and find \\(\\mathbb{E}(y_t)\\) and \\(\\operatorname{Var}(y_t)\\). 2.4 Measures of Dependence 2.4.1 Autocovariance In all but the simplest models, there is dependence between adjacent values \\(x_s\\) and \\(x_t\\). This can be assessed using the notions of covariance and correlation. The autocovariance function is defined as: \\[\\begin{align} \\gamma(s,t) &amp;= \\operatorname{Cov}(x_s, x_t) \\\\ &amp;= \\mathbb{E}((x_s - \\mu_s) (x_t - \\mu_t)) \\end{align}\\] The autocovariance measures the linear dependence between two points on the same series observed at different times. Very smooth series exhibit autocovariance functions that stay large even when the \\(t\\) and \\(s\\) are far apart, whereas choppy series tend to have autocovariance functions that are nearly zero for large separations. 2.4.2 Autocorrelation The autocorrelation function (ACF) is defined as, \\[\\begin{align} \\rho(s,t) &amp;= \\frac{\\gamma(s,t)}{\\sqrt{\\gamma(s,s) \\gamma(t,t)}} \\end{align}\\] The ACF measures the linear predictability of the series at time \\(t\\), say \\(x_t\\) , using only the value \\(x_s\\). 2.4.3 Exercise Compute the autocorrelation of: The white noise process The random walk \\(x_t = a + \\phi x_{t-1} + w_t\\) 2.5 Stationarity A (weakly) stationary time series \\(x_t\\) is a process such that, The mean is constant: \\(\\mathbb{E}(X_t) = \\mu\\) for all \\(t\\). The autocovariance function, \\(\\gamma(s,t)\\) depends on \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) only through their difference, \\(|s-t|\\). Therefore, we can write the autocovariance function of a stationary time series as, \\[\\begin{align} \\gamma(h) &amp;= \\operatorname{Cov}(x_{t+h}, x_{t}) \\\\ &amp;= \\mathbb{E}((x_{t+h} - \\mu) (x_{t} - \\mu)) \\end{align}\\] And, similarly, the autocorrelation function of a stationary time series can be written, \\[\\begin{align} \\rho(h) &amp;= \\frac{\\gamma(t+h,t)}{\\sqrt{\\gamma(t+h,t+h) \\gamma(t,t)}} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\gamma(h)}{\\gamma(0)} \\end{align}\\] 2.6 Estimation Although the theoretical mean, autocovariance, and autocorrelation functions are useful for describing the properties of certain hypothesized models, we also need to estimate these quantities using sampled data. 2.6.1 Mean If a time series is stationary, the mean function is constant so that we can estimate it by the sample mean, \\[\\begin{align} \\hat{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^T x_t \\end{align}\\] What is the variance of the sample mean in a stationary time series context? 2.6.2 Autocovariance The sample autocovariance, \\(\\hat{\\gamma}\\), for a time series \\(x\\) at lag \\(k\\) is: \\[\\begin{align} \\hat{\\gamma}_k &amp;= \\hat{\\operatorname{Cov}}(x_t, x_{t-k}) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t = k + 1}^{T} (x_t - \\bar{x})(x_{t-k} - \\bar{x}) \\end{align}\\] 2.6.3 Autocorrelation The sample autocorrelation function for lag \\(k\\), \\(\\hat{\\rho}_k\\), is simply the lag \\(k\\) autocovariance, \\(\\hat{\\gamma_k}\\), scaled by the sample variance. \\[\\begin{align} \\hat{\\rho}_k &amp;= \\frac{ \\hat{\\gamma}_k }{\\hat{\\sigma}_{y_t} \\hat{\\sigma}_{y_{t-k}}} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{ \\hat{\\gamma}_k }{\\hat{\\gamma}_0}. \\end{align}\\] 2.7 Lab 1 Join the Kayak visits data (see below) to the conversions data from Time Series EDA. Use the inner_join function with the argument, by = c(“datestamp”, “country_code”, “marketing_channel”) and then filter to only US observations. Make a plot of user_visits and conversions by day. Standardize them if it is helpful visually (i.e., subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation). Then, fit a linear regression model with conversions as the response variable and user_visits as the explanatory variable. What is the estimated line equation? Finally, make a plot of the residuals from this model. Do the residuals support standard linear regression model assumptions? visits = read.csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dbreynol/DS809/main/data/visits.csv&quot;) visits$datestamp = ymd(visits$datestamp) Smoothing a time series offers a way of visualizing the underlying trend of a process, which can often be obscured by seasonal as well as random fluctuations. One relatively simple method of smoothing a time series is by computing a moving average. For a time series \\(y_t\\), \\(t = 1, \\ldots, T\\), a moving average of order \\(m\\) can be written, \\[\\begin{align} \\hat{y_t} = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{j=-k}^{k} y_{t+j}, \\end{align}\\] where \\(m=2k+1\\). The concept behind this technique is that observations that are close in time are likely to be close in value. Compute a moving average of order \\(m=13\\) for the fma::elec dataframe. Plot the smoothed series along with the raw data in a single plot. Time series data can exhibit a variety of patterns, and it is often helpful to decompose a time series into components, each representing an underlying pattern category. In this question, you will decompose a time series into three parts: a trend component (\\(T\\)), a seasonality component (\\(S\\)), and a random component (\\(R\\)). That is, for each observation \\(Y_t\\), we want to break it down into three parts: \\[Y_T = T_t + S_t + R_t\\] You will again use the fma::elec dataframe and proceed in 3 steps: Step 1: Compute the trend component using an order 13 moving average (good news: you did exactly this in the last question, so use the output from the prior question as the trend component, \\(\\hat{T}\\)). Step 2: Compute the detrended series: \\(Y-\\hat{T}\\) Step 3: To estimate the seasonal component for each month, simply average the detrended series (computed in step 2) for each month. For example, the seasonal component for March is the average of all the detrended March values. The seasonal component is obtained by stringing together these monthly values, and then replicating the sequence for each year of data. This gives \\(\\hat{S}\\). Step 4: The remainder component is calculated by subtracting the estimated seasonal and trend-cycle components. That is \\(\\hat{R} = Y - \\hat{T} - \\hat{S}\\). Provide your code that is clearly commented for each step as well as a plot that shows each of the three component series in three separate plots (hint: use par(mfrow = c(1,3)) to make three plots in a row). See chapter 1 of TSA (page 30) for a definition of cross correlation. This is a measure of the linear dependence of one time series on another. In other words, this is a multivariate version of the autocorrelation. Compute the cross correlation between GDP per capita and the Case Shiller Home Price Index (both from the FRED database), using the following data: fred = read.csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dbreynol/DS809/main/data/fred_dat.csv&quot;)[,-1] fred$date = ymd(fred$date) Provide your code that computes the ccf for lag 0 and 1:10 in both directions (i.e., one where GDP/capita leads and the other in which the Case Shiller leads). Validate your calculations using the ccf function. From the text, we aim to compute: \\[\\begin{align} \\hat{\\gamma}_{xy}(h) = n^{-1} \\sum_{t=1}^{n-h} (x_{t+h}-\\bar{x})(y_t - \\bar{y}) \\end{align}\\] Write a function in R that takes two arguments: a time series (\\(y\\)) vector and a vector (\\(k\\)) specifying a set of lags. The output for this function is the autocorrelation of \\(y\\) for each lag in \\(k\\), using the formula in Autocorrelation. Compare the output of your function to the output from (acf(y)). Simulate data from the following model: \\(x_t = a + \\phi x_{t-1} + w_t\\), in which \\(w_t \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)\\). You can choose the value for parameters: \\(\\phi, \\sigma^2, a\\). Report which values you chose and make a plot of the theoretical versus observed autocorrelation function for a simulation with length \\(T=100\\) and a simulation with length \\(T=10,000\\).

The difference operator and the backshift operator are related \\[ \\nabla^k = (1 - \\mathbf{B})^k \\] Differencing is a simple means for removing a trend The 1st-difference removes a linear trend A 2nd-difference will remove a quadratic trend 3.2 Autoregressive (AR) models An autoregressive model of order p, or AR(p), is defined as \\[x_t = \\phi_1 x_{t-1} + \\phi_2 x_{t-2} + \\dots + \\phi_p x_{t-p} + w_t\\] where we assume \\(w_t\\) is white noise \\(\\phi_p \\neq 0\\) for an order-p process 3.2.1 AR(1) Model Let’s start by figuring out some properties of the simplest AR model, the AR(1) model: \\[x_t = \\phi_0 + \\phi_1 x_{t-1} + w_t\\] We start by assuming that \\(x_t\\) is a stationary time series. Under this assumption, we can show: \\[\\begin{align} \\mathbb{E}(x_t) &amp;= \\frac{\\phi_0}{1-\\phi_1} \\\\ \\operatorname{Var}(x_t) &amp;= \\frac{\\sigma^2_w}{1-\\phi_1^2} \\\\ \\rho(h) &amp;= \\phi_1^h \\end{align}\\] For this to work, \\(|\\phi_1| &lt; 1\\). 3.2.2 AR Stationarity We seek a means for identifying whether our AR(p) models are also stationary. We can write out an AR(p) model using the backshift operator: \\[ x_t = \\phi_1 x_{t-1} + \\phi_2 x_{t-2} + \\dots + \\phi_p x_{t-p} + w_t \\\\ \\Downarrow \\\\ \\begin{align} x_t - \\phi_1 x_{t-1} - \\phi_2 x_{t-2} - \\dots - \\phi_p x_{t-p} &amp;= w_t \\\\ (1 - \\phi_1 \\mathbf{B} - \\phi_2 \\mathbf{B}^2 - \\dots - \\phi_p \\mathbf{B}^p) x_t &amp;= w_t \\\\ \\phi_p (\\mathbf{B}^p) x_t &amp;= w_t \\\\ \\end{align} \\] If we treat \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) as a number (or numbers), we can out write the characteristic equation as \\(\\phi_p (\\mathbf{B}^p)\\). To be stationary, all roots of the characteristic equation must exceed 1 in absolute value As a bonus, when this condition is met, then the model is also causal. Example, for what value of \\(\\phi_1\\) is AR(1) model stationary? Are the following AR processes stationary? \\(x_t = 0.5 x_{t-1} + w_t\\) \\(x_t = -0.2 x_{t-1} + 0.4 x_{t-2} + w_t\\) \\(x_t = x_{t-1} + w_t\\) 3.2.3 Autocorrelation The exponential decay observed in autocorrelation function for the the AR(1) model holds in general for AR(p). This decay may oscillate, as shown below. 3.3 Moving Average (MA) models A moving average model of order q, or MA(q), is defined as \\[ x_t = w_t + \\theta_1 w_{t-1} + \\theta_2 w_{t-2} + \\dots + \\theta_q w_{t-q}\\] where \\(w_t\\) is white noise Each of the \\(x_t\\) is a sum of the most recent error terms Thus, all MA processes are stationary because they are finite sums of stationary WN processes 3.3.1 Examples of MA(q) models 3.3.2 MA(1) Model Let’s start by figuring out some properties of the simplest MA model, the MA(1) model: \\[ x_t = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 w_{t-1} + w_t \\] We start by assuming that \\(x_t\\) is a stationary time series. Under this assumption, we can show: \\[\\begin{align} \\mathbb{E}(x_t) &amp;= \\theta_0 \\\\ \\operatorname{Var}(x_t) &amp;= \\sigma^2_w(1+\\theta_1^2) \\\\ \\rho(h) &amp;= \\frac{\\theta_1}{1+\\theta_1^2} \\text{ for } h=1 \\text{ and 0 otherwise. } \\end{align}\\] 3.3.3 Invertibility For MA models, we need invertibility in order to identify model paramters. An MA(q) process is invertible if it can be written as a stationary autoregressive process of infinite order without an error term \\[ x_t = w_t + \\theta_1 w_{t-1} + \\theta_2 w_{t-2} + \\dots + \\theta_q w_{t-q} \\\\ \\Downarrow ? \\\\ w_t = x_t + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty(-\\theta)^k x_{t-k} \\] For example, these MA(1) models are equivalent \\[ x_t = w_t + \\frac{1}{5} w_{t-1} ~\\text{with} ~w_t \\sim ~\\text{N}(0,25) \\\\ \\Updownarrow \\\\ x_t = w_t + 5 w_{t-1} ~\\text{with} ~w_t \\sim ~\\text{N}(0,1) \\] Rewrite an MA(1) model in terms of \\(w_t\\) \\[ x_t = w_t + \\theta w_{t-1} \\\\ \\Downarrow \\\\ w_t = x_t - \\theta w_{t-1} \\\\ \\] If we constrain \\(\\lvert \\theta \\rvert &lt; 1\\), then \\[ \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} (-\\theta)^{k+1} w_{t-k-1} = 0 \\] and \\[ \\begin{align} w_t &amp;= x_t - \\theta x_{t-1} - \\dots -\\theta^k x_{t-k} -\\theta^{k+1} w_{t-k-1} \\\\ w_t &amp;= x_t - \\theta x_{t-1} - \\dots -\\theta^k x_{t-k} \\\\ w_t &amp;= x_t + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty(-\\theta)^k x_{t-k} \\end{align} \\] 3.3.4 Autocorrelation For the MA(q) model, the autocovariance function cuts off for \\(h &gt;q\\). That is, \\[\\begin{align} \\gamma(h) &amp;= \\sigma^2 \\sum_{j=0}^{q-h} \\theta_j \\theta_{j+h}~\\text{for }h=0,\\ldots,q \\\\ \\gamma(h) &amp;= 0~h&gt;q \\end{align}\\] Therefore, the sample ACF is useful for model identification when our data comes from a moving average process, but not so useful for data that comes from an AR process. For this, we introduce the partial autocorrelation (PACF). 3.4 PACF 3.4.1 Definition The partial autocorrelation of a stationary process, \\(x_t\\), denoted \\(\\phi_{hh}\\), for \\(h=1,2,\\ldots\\), is \\[\\phi_{11}=\\text{cor}(x_{t}, x_{t-1}) = \\rho_1\\] and, \\[\\phi_{hh}=\\text{cor}(x_{t}-\\hat{x}_t, x_{t-h} - \\hat{x}_{t-h}),~~h \\geq 2\\]. The PACF, \\(\\phi_{hh}\\), is the correlation between \\(x_t\\) and \\(x_{t-h}\\) with the linear dependence of \\(\\{x_{t-1}, \\ldots, x_{t-h+1} \\}\\) on each, removed. 3.4.2 AR(1) PACF Let us calculate \\(\\phi_{22}\\) for the AR(1) model, \\(x_t = \\phi x_{t-1} + w_t\\). Consider the regression of \\(x_t\\) on \\(x_{t-1}\\). Choose \\(\\beta\\) to minimize, \\[\\begin{align} E(x_t - \\beta x_{t-1})^2 &amp;= \\gamma(0) - 2\\beta \\gamma(1) + \\beta^2 \\gamma(0) \\end{align}\\] Minimize the expression above to find the estimator of \\(\\beta\\). Plug in this estimated quantity to \\(\\text{cor}(x_{t}-\\hat{x}_{t-1}, x_{t-2} - \\hat{x}_{t-2})\\) 3.4.3 PACF for AR(p) For an AR(p) model, when \\(h &gt; p\\), \\(\\phi_{hh} = 0\\). Thus, the PACF is very informative for model identification when data comes from an autoregressive process. 3.5 AR Estimation 3.5.1 Yule-Walker Equations Consider the AR(p) model, \\(x_t = \\phi_1 x_{t-1} + \\phi_2 x_{t-2} + \\phi_3 x_{t-3} + w_t\\) Now, take the following steps, Multiply both sides by \\(x_{t-1}\\) Take an expectation This leads to, \\[ \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} \\gamma(1) \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\gamma(p) \\end{array} \\right] = \\begin{pmatrix} \\gamma(0) &amp; \\ldots &amp; \\gamma(p-1) \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ \\gamma(p-1) &amp; \\ldots &amp; \\gamma(0) \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} \\phi_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\phi_p \\end{array} \\right] \\] Or, succinctly, \\[\\mathbf{\\gamma} = \\mathbf{\\Gamma} \\mathbf{\\phi}\\] Which can be solved as, \\[\\hat{ \\mathbf{\\phi} } = \\mathbf{\\Gamma} ^ {-1}\\mathbf{\\gamma} \\] The remaining parameter to be estimated is \\(\\sigma^2\\), the variance of the white noise term. An estimator can be established by multiplying the model by \\(x_t\\), which leads to \\[\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\hat{\\gamma}(0) - \\sum_{i=1}^{p}\\hat{\\phi}_i \\hat{\\gamma}(i)\\] 3.5.2 Example Suppose you aim to estimate \\(\\mathbf{\\phi}\\) for a dataset in which \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{\\gamma}} = (3.8,3.1,3,2.8)\\). What is the Yule-Walker estimate for \\(\\mathbf{\\phi}\\) and also for \\(\\sigma\\)? 3.6 ARMA models An autoregressive moving average, or ARMA(p,q), model is written as \\[ x_t = \\phi_1 x_{t-1} + \\dots + \\phi_p x_{t-p} + w_t + \\theta_1 w_{t-1} + \\dots + \\theta_q w_{t-q} \\] We can write an ARMA(p,q) model using the backshift operator \\[ \\phi_p (\\mathbf{B}^p) x_t= \\theta_q (\\mathbf{B}^q) w_t \\] ARMA models are stationary if all roots of \\(\\phi_p (\\mathbf{B}) &gt; 1\\) ARMA models are invertible if all roots of \\(\\theta_q (\\mathbf{B}) &gt; 1\\) 3.6.1 \\(\\psi\\) representation For a causal ARMA\\((p,q)\\) model, \\(\\phi_p (\\mathbf{B}^p) x_t= \\theta_q (\\mathbf{B}^q) w_t\\), we may write \\[\\begin{align} x_t = \\sum_{j=0}^\\infty \\psi_j w_{t-j}. \\end{align}\\] Solving for the \\(\\psi\\) weights in general is complicated and can be solved using the ARMAtoMA function in R. 3.6.2 ARMA(1,1) Solve for the \\(\\psi\\) wieghts in the case of a causal, invertible ARMA(1,1) process. 3.6.3 Forecasting To forecast with an ARMA model, we simply use the parameter estimates for future periods. For example, consider the following dataset of 500 observations simulated from an ARMA(1,1) process. set.seed(1) ex_ts_arma = arima.sim(n = 500, list(ar = c(.8), ma = c(-.3))) arma_fit = Arima(ex_ts_arma, order = c(1,0,1), include.mean = F) The fitted model is \\(x_t = 0.7732447 x_{t-1} -0.2942922 w_{t-1}\\). To forecast two observations in the future, we simply use the parameter estimates as follows: w_vec = abs( fitted(arma_fit) - ex_ts_arma) h1 = coefficients(arma_fit)[1] * ex_ts_arma[500] + coefficients(arma_fit)[2] * w_vec[500] # 0.2161869 h2 = coefficients(arma_fit)[1] * h1 Our one step ahead forecast is 0.2161869 and the two step ahead forecast is 0.1671654. The same values can be computed using forecast(arma_fit, h=2)$mean. 3.6.4 Forecast Errors In order to compute forecast errors, we will make use of the following two parameters: \\[\\begin{align} x_{T+h} &amp;= \\sum_{j=0}^\\infty \\psi_j w_{T+h-j} \\\\ \\tilde{x}_{T+h} &amp;= E( x_{T+h} | x_1, \\ldots, x_T ) \\end{align}\\] Since \\(E(w_t | x_1, \\ldots, x_T) = w_t\\) for \\(t \\leq T\\) and 0 for \\(t &gt; T\\), \\[\\begin{align} x_{T+h} - \\tilde{x}_{T+h} &amp;= \\sum_{j=0}^{h-1} \\psi_j w_{T+h-j} \\\\ \\end{align}\\] Therefore, the variance of this quantity is: \\[\\begin{align} \\sigma^2 \\sum_{j=0}^{h-1} \\psi_j ^2 \\\\ \\end{align}\\] With the assumption of normally distributed errors, a 95% prediction interval for \\(x_{T+h}\\) is, \\[\\begin{align} \\hat{x}_{T+h} \\pm 1.96 \\sqrt{ \\hat{\\sigma}^2_w \\sum_{j=0}^{h-1} \\psi_j^2 } \\end{align}\\] psis = ARMAtoMA(ar = coefficients(arma_fit)[1], ma = coefficients(arma_fit)[2], lag.max = 2) # confidence interval for one step ahead forecast c(h1 - qnorm(.975) * sqrt( arma_fit$sigma2 ) , h1 + qnorm(.975) * sqrt ( arma_fit$sigma2 )) # (-1.8, 2.2) # confidence interval for 2 step ahead forecast h2_se = sqrt( arma_fit$sigma2 * (1 + psis[1]^2 ) ) c(h2 - qnorm(.975) * h2_se, h2 + qnorm(.975) * h2_se) # (-2.0, 2.4) Or, use forecast(arma_fit, h = 2) 3.6.5 Recap model id table Model ACF PACF AR(p) Tails off slowly Cuts off after lag p MA(q) Cuts off after lag q Tails off slowly ARMA(p,q) Tails off slowly Tails off slowly 3.7 Lab 2 Simulate data from the MA(1) model: \\(x_t = w_t+\\theta_1w_{t-1}\\) in which \\(\\theta = (0.7)\\). For sample sizes \\(n=10,10^3,10^5\\), plot the difference between the theoretical autocorrelation and the observed (sample) autocorrelation for lags 1 through 5. What do you observe? Do the same thing for an MA(3) model. Include which values you use for \\(\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\theta_3\\). See page 96 of the textbook for the theoretical AFC function for the MA(3) model. From page 96, for \\(1 \\leq h \\leq q\\) \\[\\begin{align} \\rho(h) = \\frac{\\sigma^2_w \\sum_{j=0}^{q-h} \\theta_j \\theta_{j+h}}{1+\\theta_1^2 + \\ldots + \\theta_q^2}, \\end{align}\\] and \\(\\rho(h) = 0\\) for \\(h &gt; q\\). For an AR(1), derive an expression for \\(\\phi_{22}\\) (the lag 2 partial ACF). Follow the steps in AR(1) PACF. See also page 100 in the textbook. Using ACF &amp; PACF for model ID. Complete the table with either cuts off after \\(\\ldots\\) or tails off slowly. Back up the 3 entries you fill in with either math or with empirical data (simulate data from the model type and show the relevant estimate quantities). Suppose you aim to estimate \\(\\mathbf{\\phi}\\) for an AR(2) model in which \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{\\gamma}} = (2.1,1.5,1.3)\\) (i.e., \\(\\hat{\\gamma}(0)=2.1)\\). What is the Yule-Walker estimate for \\(\\mathbf{\\phi}\\) and also for \\(\\sigma\\)? See AR Estimation for details. \\[ \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} 1.5 \\\\ 1.3 \\end{array} \\right] = \\begin{pmatrix} 2.1 &amp; 1.5 \\\\ 1.5 &amp; 2.1 \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} \\phi_1 \\\\ \\phi_2 \\end{array} \\right] \\] Using the Egyptian export data from class, compute the 95% interval for the one period and 2 period ahead forecasts. Use the \\(\\psi\\) representation from Forecast Errors. You can find the \\(\\phi\\) values using ARMAtoMA. Validate your answers using forecast::forecast. \\[\\begin{align} \\hat{x}_{T+h} \\pm 1.96 \\sqrt{ \\hat{\\sigma}^2_w \\sum_{j=0}^{h-1} \\psi_j^2 } \\end{align}\\] "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
