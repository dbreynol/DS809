Time series data creates unique problems for statistical modeling and inference. Traditional inference assumes that observations (data) are independent and identically distributed. Adjacent data points in time series data are not necessarily independent (uncorrelated). Most time series models aim to exploit such dependence. For instance, yesterday’s demand of a product may tell us something about today’s demand of a product. There are several different ways to represent time series data in R. We will use the tidyverse family of packages extensively in this class. This package includes the lubridate package, which includes functions to work with date-times. Two of the most common ways to represent time series data are using data frames in which one of the variables is a time object (such as POSIXct or Date) or using a time series object. 2.2 Time Series EDA The first thing to do in any data analysis is exploratory data analysis (EDA). Graphs enable many features of the data to be visualized, including patterns, unusual observations, changes over time, and relationships between variables. The features that are seen in plots of the data can then be incorporated into statistical models. R has several systems for making graphs. We will primarily use ggplot2, which is among the set of tidyverse packages and is one of the most versatile systems for plotting. We will use a data set from Kayak to motivate our analysis. conversions = read.csv(&quot;data/conversions.csv&quot;) #read.csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dbreynol/DS809/main/data/conversions.csv&quot;) knitr::kable(head(conversions)) datestamp country_code marketing_channel conversions 2014-11-01 be Display Ads 1174 2014-11-01 be KAYAK Deals Email 57 2014-11-01 be Search Engine Ads 1122 2014-11-01 be Search Engine Results 976 2014-11-01 fi Display Ads 12 2014-11-01 fi Search Engine Results 2 This dataset contains information on the total number of daily conversions by country and marketing channel. Let us focus our analysis on the US and first visualize the number of conversions by day. This plot contains a lot of useful information. To gain insight into how conversions depend on marketing channel, we can use facets. Facets are subplots that display a time series for each marketing channel. Display ads and search engine ads are the dominant marketing channels. Both have a regular pattern that is likely a function of the day of week, with a higher number of conversions during weekdays as compared with weekends. We can explore this feature by aggregating over each weekday and visualizing how the distribution of conversions changes by day. Clearly, there are significant changes in the mean level of conversions across the week. This is a form of seasonality. It may be useful to see what the data look like when this weekday effect is removed. To do so, we could visualize the residuals from the following linear regression model: \\[\\begin{align} \\hat{\\text{conversions}} = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\sum_{j=2}^7 \\bigg( \\hat{\\beta}_j \\times 1(\\text{weekday = j}) \\bigg), \\end{align}\\] where \\(j\\) indexes the day of week. The residuals from this model consist of each observation minus the mean for that particular weekday. This allows us to more clearly see the trend across the date range, removing the effect of the weekly pattern. 2.3 Classical Regression Given that regression is already in our tool kit, we will use it as our first method to model a time series. Let us assume that we have some output or dependent time series, say, \\(x_t\\) , for \\(t = 1, \\ldots,n\\), that is being influenced by a collection of possible inputs, say, \\(z_{t1}, z_{t2}, \\ldots, z_{tq}\\), where we regard the inputs as fixed and known. We will look at monthly Australian electricity production (the fpp2::elec dataframe). The data is shown below. Let us fit two models to this data, one where we use time as the independent variable. This estimates a linear trend. In the other, we will try to capture some of the obvious seasonality in the data. \\[\\begin{align} y_t &amp;= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 t + w_t \\\\ y_t &amp;= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 t + \\beta_2 \\times ({2\\pi \\cos(t)}) + w_t \\end{align}\\] The fits from these two models are shown below. Clearly, model 2 offers a superior fit as compared with model 1. In fact, this model explains about 95% of the variation in electricity production. To check the validity of the model, let us examine the residuals across the range of time, \\(t\\). One of the assumptions of the linear regression model is that the errors are independent and identically distributed. That is, for the model, \\[\\begin{align} y = X \\beta + \\epsilon, \\end{align}\\] The error vector, \\(\\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\), consists of independent and identically distributed random variables. This implies that there is no correlation structure to the residuals. One way to check that this is true is to check for the absence of correlation in the observed residuals. What does the figure above indicate about the validity of this assumption for model 2? 2.4 Noise Processes What if we re-arrange the model we fit above into a deterministic part and a random part: \\[\\begin{align} y_t - x_t \\beta = w_t \\end{align}\\] What can we say about the right hand side? Since it is a random variable that is indexed by time, we can consider this our first and simplest time series model. 2.4.1 White noise Let \\(w_t\\) be a random variable indexed by time, \\(t \\in [1,T]\\). The following properties characterize white noise: \\[\\begin{align} E(w_t) &amp;= 0 \\\\ Var(w_t) &amp;= \\sigma^2 \\\\ Cov(w_t, w_s) &amp;= 0 \\text{ } \\forall t,s \\end{align}\\] Note that Gaussian white noise is a special case where \\(w_t \\sim N(o, \\sigma^2)\\). White noise can come in different flavors. In the right hand plot below, \\(w_t = 2e_t - 1\\), where \\(e_t \\sim \\text{Bernoulli(.5)}\\). In the left plot, \\(w_t \\sim N(0,2)\\). 2.4.2 Random Walk Let us consider another simple model to describe time series data, \\(y_t = y_{t-1}+w_t\\), where \\(w_t \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\) and all elements of the error vector are mutually independent. Let’s derive some important properties of this model: What is the mean, \\(E(y_t)\\)? What is the variance, \\(Var(y_t)\\)? 2.4.3 AR Process A slightly more general model is the AR model, in which \\(x_t\\) is a linear combination of its past \\(p\\) values plus gaussian white noise, \\(w_t\\). That is, \\[\\begin{align} x_t = \\sum_{i=1}^p \\phi_i x_{t-i} + w_t. \\end{align}\\] 2.4.4 Exercise Consider the AR(1) process with a drift: \\[\\begin{align} x_t &amp;= a + \\phi x_t + w_t \\end{align}\\] Write \\(x_t\\) as a function of past white noise values and find \\(E(x_t)\\) and \\(Var(x_t)\\). 2.5 Measures of Dependence 2.5.1 Autocovariance In all but the simplest models, there is dependence between adjacent values \\(x_s\\) and \\(x_t\\). This can be assessed using the notions of covariance and correlation. The autocovariance function is defined as the second moment product: \\[\\begin{align} \\gamma(s,t) &amp;= \\text{cov}(x_s, x_t) \\\\ &amp;= E((x_s - \\mu_s) (x_t - \\mu_t)) \\end{align}\\] The autocovariance measures the linear dependence between two points on the same series observed at different times. Very smooth series exhibit autocovariance functions that stay large even when the \\(t\\) and \\(s\\) are far apart, whereas choppy series tend to have autocovariance functions that are nearly zero for large separations. 2.5.2 Autocorrelation The autocorrelation function (ACF) is defined as, \\[\\begin{align} \\rho(s,t) &amp;= \\frac{\\gamma(s,t)}{\\sqrt{\\gamma(s,s) \\gamma(t,t)}} \\end{align}\\] The ACF measures the linear predictability of the series at time \\(t\\), say \\(x_t\\) , using only the value \\(x_s\\). 2.5.3 Exercise Compute the autocorrelation of: The white noise process The random walk \\(x_t = a + \\phi x_{t-1} + w_t\\) 2.6 Stationarity A (weakly) stationary time series \\(x_t\\) is a process such that, The mean is constant: \\(E(X_t) = \\mu\\). The autocovariance function, \\(\\gamma(s,t)\\) depends on \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) only through their difference, \\(|s-t|\\). Therefore, we can write the autocovariance function of a stationary time series as, \\[\\begin{align} \\gamma(h) &amp;= \\text{cov}(x_{t+h}, x_{t}) \\\\ &amp;= E((x_{t+h} - \\mu) (x_{t} - \\mu)) \\end{align}\\] And, similarly, the autocorrelation function of a stationary time series can be written, \\[\\begin{align} \\rho(h) &amp;= \\frac{\\gamma(t+h,t)}{\\sqrt{\\gamma(t+h,t+h) \\gamma(t,t)}} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\gamma(h)}{\\gamma(0)} \\end{align}\\] 2.7 Estimation Although the theoretical mean, autocovariance, and autocorrelation functions are useful for describing the properties of certain hypothesized models, we also need to estimate these quantities using sampled data. 2.7.1 Mean If a time series is stationary, the mean function is constant so that we can estimate it by the sample mean, \\[\\begin{align} \\hat{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^T x_t \\end{align}\\] What is the variance of the mean in a stationary time series context? 2.7.2 Autocovariance The sample autocovariance, \\(\\hat{\\gamma}\\), for a time series \\(x\\) at lag \\(k\\) is: \\[\\begin{align} \\hat{\\gamma}_k &amp;= \\text{cov}(x_t, x_{t-k}) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t = k + 1}^{T} (x_t - \\bar{x})(x_{t-k} - \\bar{x}) \\end{align}\\] 2.7.3 Autocorrelation The sample autocorrelation function for lag \\(k\\), \\(\\hat{\\rho}_k\\), is simply the lag \\(k\\) autocovariance, \\(\\hat{\\gamma_k}\\), scaled by the sample variance. \\[\\begin{align} \\hat{\\rho}_k &amp;= \\frac{ \\hat{\\gamma_k} }{\\hat{\\sigma}_{y_t} \\hat{\\sigma}_{y_{t-k}}} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{ \\hat{\\gamma_k} }{\\hat{\\gamma_0}}. \\end{align}\\] 2.8 Lab 1 Join the Kayak visits data (see below) to the conversions data from Time Series EDA. Use the inner_join function with the argument, by = c(“datestamp”, “country_code”, “marketing_channel”) and then filter to only US observations. Make a plot of user_visits and conversions by day. Standardize them if it makes sense. Then, fit a linear regression model with conversions as the response variable and user_visits as the explanatory variable. What is the estimated line equation? Finally, make a plot of the residuals from this model. Do the residuals validate standard linear regression model assumptions? visits = read.csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dbreynol/DS809/main/data/visits.csv&quot;) visits$datestamp = ymd(visits$datestamp) Smoothing a time series offers a way of visualizing the underlying trend of a process, which can often be obscured by seasonal as well as random fluctuations. One relatively simple method of smoothing a time series is by computing a moving average. For a time series \\(y_t\\), \\(t = 1, \\ldots, T\\), a moving average of order \\(m\\) can be written, \\[\\begin{align} \\hat{y_t} = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{j=-k}^{k} y_{t+j}, \\end{align}\\] where \\(m=2k+1\\). The concept behind this technique is that observations that are close in time are likely to be close in value. Compute a moving average of order \\(m=13\\) for the fpp2::elec dataframe used in Classical Regression. Plot the smoothed series along with the raw data in a single plot. Time series data can exhibit a variety of patterns, and it is often helpful to decompose a time series into components, each representing an underlying pattern category. In this question, you will decompose a time series into three parts: a trend component (\\(T\\)), a seasonality component (\\(S\\)), and a random component (\\(R\\)). That is, for each observation \\(Y_t\\), we want to break it down into three parts: \\[Y_T = T_t + S_t + R_t\\] You will again use the fpp2::elec dataframe and proceed in 3 steps: Step 1: Compute the trend component using an order 13 moving average (good news: you did exactly this in the last question, so use the output from the prior question as the trend component, \\(\\hat{T}\\)). Step 2: Compute the detrended series: \\(Y-\\hat{T}\\) Step 3: To estimate the seasonal component for each month, simply average the detrended values for each month. For example, the seasonal component for March is the average of all the detrended March values in the data. Then adjust the seasonal component values to ensure that they add to zero. The seasonal component is obtained by stringing together these monthly values, and then replicating the sequence for each year of data. This gives \\(\\hat{S}\\). Step 4: The remainder component is calculated by subtracting the estimated seasonal and trend-cycle components. That is \\(\\hat{R} = Y - \\hat{T} - \\hat{S}\\). Provide your code that is clearly commented for each step as well as a plot that shows each of the three component series in three separate plots (hint: use par(mfrow = c(1,3)) to make three plots in a row). See chapter 1 of TSA (page 18) for a definition of cross correlation. This is a measure of the linear dependence of one time series on another. In other words, this is a multivariate version of the autocorrelation. Compute the cross correlation between GDP per capita and the Case Shiller Home Price Index (both from the FRED database), using the following data: fred = read.csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dbreynol/DS809/main/data/fred_dat.csv&quot;)[,-1] fred$date = ymd(fred$date) Provide your code and validate it using the ccf function. Write a function in R that takes two arguments: a time series (\\(y\\)) formatted as a vector and a vector (\\(k\\)) specifying a set of lags. The output for this function is the autocorrelation of \\(y\\) for each lag in \\(k\\), using the formula in Autocorrelation. Compare the output of your function to the output from (acf(y)).

The difference operator and the backshift operator are related \\[ \\nabla^k = (1 - \\mathbf{B})^k \\] Differencing is a simple means for removing a trend The 1st-difference removes a linear trend A 2nd-difference will remove a quadratic trend 3.2 Autoregressive (AR) models An autoregressive model of order p, or AR(p), is defined as \\[x_t = \\phi_1 x_{t-1} + \\phi_2 x_{t-2} + \\dots + \\phi_p x_{t-p} + w_t\\] where we assume \\(w_t\\) is white noise \\(\\phi_p \\neq 0\\) for an order-p process 3.2.1 AR(1) Model Let’s start by figuring out some properties of the simplest AR model, the AR(1) model: \\[x_t = \\phi_0 + \\phi_1 x_{t-1} + w_t\\] We start by assuming that \\(x_t\\) is a stationary time series. Under this assumption, we can show: \\[\\begin{align} E(x_t) &amp;= \\frac{\\phi_0}{1-\\phi_1} \\\\ Var(x_t) &amp;= \\frac{\\sigma^2_w}{1-\\phi_1^2} \\\\ \\rho(h) &amp;= \\phi_1^h \\end{align}\\] For this to work, \\(|\\phi_1| &lt; 1\\). 3.2.2 Stationarity We seek a means for identifying whether our AR(p) models are also stationary. We can write out an AR(p) model using the backshift operator: \\[ x_t = \\phi_1 x_{t-1} + \\phi_2 x_{t-2} + \\dots + \\phi_p x_{t-p} + w_t \\\\ \\Downarrow \\\\ \\begin{align} x_t - \\phi_1 x_{t-1} - \\phi_2 x_{t-2} - \\dots - \\phi_p x_{t-p} &amp;= w_t \\\\ (1 - \\phi_1 \\mathbf{B} - \\phi_2 \\mathbf{B}^2 - \\dots - \\phi_p \\mathbf{B}^p) x_t &amp;= w_t \\\\ \\phi_p (\\mathbf{B}^p) x_t &amp;= w_t \\\\ \\end{align} \\] If we treat \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) as a number (or numbers), we can out write the characteristic equation as \\(\\phi_p (\\mathbf{B}^p)\\). To be stationary, all roots of the characteristic equation must exceed 1 in absolute value As a bonus, when this condition is met, then the model is also causal. Example, for what value of \\(\\phi_1\\) is AR(1) model stationary? Are the following AR processes stationary? \\(x_t = 0.5 x_{t-1} + w_t\\) \\(x_t = -0.2 x_{t-1} + 0.4 x_{t-2} + w_t\\) \\(x_t = x_{t-1} + w_t\\) 3.2.3 Autocorrelation The exponential decay observed in autocorrelation function for the the AR(1) model holds in general for AR(p). This decay may oscillate, as shown below. 3.3 Moving Average (MA) models A moving average model of order q, or MA(q), is defined as \\[ x_t = w_t + \\theta_1 w_{t-1} + \\theta_2 w_{t-2} + \\dots + \\theta_q w_{t-q}\\] where \\(w_t\\) is white noise Each of the \\(x_t\\) is a sum of the most recent error terms Thus, all MA processes are stationary because they are finite sums of stationary WN processes 3.3.1 Examples of MA(q) models 3.3.2 MA(1) Model Let’s start by figuring out some properties of the simplest MA model, the MA(1) model: \\[ x_t = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 w_{t-1} + w_t \\] We start by assuming that \\(x_t\\) is a stationary time series. Under this assumption, we can show: \\[\\begin{align} E(x_t) &amp;= \\theta_0 \\\\ Var(x_t) &amp;= \\sigma^2_w(1+\\theta_1^2) \\\\ \\rho(h) &amp;= \\frac{\\theta_1}{1+\\theta_1^2} \\text{ for } h=1 \\text{ and 0 otherwise. } \\end{align}\\] 3.3.3 Invertibility For MA models, we need invertibility in order to identify model paramters. An MA(q) process is invertible if it can be written as a stationary autoregressive process of infinite order without an error term \\[ x_t = w_t + \\theta_1 w_{t-1} + \\theta_2 w_{t-2} + \\dots + \\theta_q w_{t-q} \\\\ \\Downarrow ? \\\\ w_t = x_t + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty(-\\theta)^k x_{t-k} \\] For example, these MA(1) models are equivalent \\[ x_t = w_t + \\frac{1}{5} w_{t-1} ~\\text{with} ~w_t \\sim ~\\text{N}(0,25) \\\\ \\Updownarrow \\\\ x_t = w_t + 5 w_{t-1} ~\\text{with} ~w_t \\sim ~\\text{N}(0,1) \\] Rewrite an MA(1) model in terms of \\(w_t\\) \\[ x_t = w_t + \\theta w_{t-1} \\\\ \\Downarrow \\\\ w_t = x_t - \\theta w_{t-1} \\\\ \\] If we constrain \\(\\lvert \\theta \\rvert &lt; 1\\), then \\[ \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} (-\\theta)^{k+1} w_{t-k-1} = 0 \\] and \\[ \\begin{align} w_t &amp;= x_t - \\theta x_{t-1} - \\dots -\\theta^k x_{t-k} -\\theta^{k+1} w_{t-k-1} \\\\ w_t &amp;= x_t - \\theta x_{t-1} - \\dots -\\theta^k x_{t-k} \\\\ w_t &amp;= x_t + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty(-\\theta)^k x_{t-k} \\end{align} \\] 3.3.4 Autocorrelation For the MA(q) model, the autocorrelation function cuts off for \\(h &gt;q\\). That is, \\[\\begin{align} \\gamma(h) &amp;= \\sigma^2 \\sum_{j=0}^{q-h} \\theta_j \\theta_{j+h}~\\text{for }h=0,\\ldots,q \\\\ \\gamma(h) &amp;= 0~h&gt;q \\end{align}\\] Therefore, the sample ACF is useful for model identification when our data comes from a moving average process, but not so useful for data that comes from an AR process. For this, we introduce the partial autocorrelation (PACF). 3.4 PACF 3.4.1 Definition The partial autocorrelation of a stationary process, \\(x_t\\), denoted \\(\\phi_{hh}\\), for \\(h=1,2,\\ldots\\), is \\[\\phi_{11}=\\text{cor}(x_{t}, x_{t-1}) = \\rho_1\\] and, \\[\\phi_{hh}=\\text{cor}(x_{t}-\\hat{x}_t, x_{t-h} - \\hat{x}_{t-h}),~~h \\geq 2\\]. The PACF, \\(\\phi_{hh}\\), is the correlation between \\(x_t\\) and \\(x_{t-h}\\) with the linear dependence of \\(\\{x_{t-1}, \\ldots, x_{t-h+1} \\}\\) on each, removed. 3.4.2 AR(1) PACF Let us calculate \\(\\phi_{22}\\) for the AR(1) model, \\(x_t = \\phi x_{t-1} + w_t\\). Consider the regression of \\(x_t\\) on \\(x_{t-1}\\). Choose \\(\\beta\\) to minimize, \\[\\begin{align} E(x_t - \\beta x_{t-1})^2 &amp;= \\gamma(0) - 2\\beta \\gamma(1) + \\beta^2 \\gamma(0) \\end{align}\\] Minimize the expression above to find the estimator of \\(\\beta\\). Plug in this estimated quantity to \\(\\text{cor}(x_{t}-\\hat{x}_{t-1}, x_{t-2} - \\hat{x}_{t-2})\\) 3.4.3 PACF for AR(p) For an AR(p) model, when \\(h &gt; p\\), \\(\\phi_{hh} = 0\\). Thus, the PACF is very informative for model identification when data comes from an autoregressive process. 3.5 AR Estimation 3.5.1 Yule-Walker Equations Consider the AR(p) model, \\(x_t =\\) Now, take the following steps, Multiply both sides by \\(x_{t-1}\\) Take an expectation This leads to, \\[ \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} \\gamma(1) \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\gamma(p) \\end{array} \\right] = \\begin{pmatrix} \\gamma(0) &amp; \\ldots &amp; \\gamma(p-1) \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ \\gamma(p-1) &amp; \\ldots &amp; \\gamma(0) \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} \\phi_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\phi_p \\end{array} \\right] \\] Or, succinctly, \\[\\mathbf{\\gamma} = \\mathbf{\\Gamma} \\mathbf{\\phi}\\] Which can be solved as, \\[\\hat{ \\mathbf{\\phi} } = \\mathbf{\\Gamma} ^ {-1}\\mathbf{\\gamma} \\] The remaining parameter to be estimated is \\(\\sigma^2\\), the variance of the white noise term. An estimator can be established by multiplying the model by \\(x_t\\), which leads to \\[\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\hat{\\gamma}(0) - \\sum_{i=1}^{p}\\hat{\\phi}_i \\hat{\\gamma}(i)\\] 3.5.2 Example Suppose you aim to estimate \\(\\mathbf{\\phi}\\) for a dataset in which \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{\\gamma}} = (3.8,3.1,3,2.8)\\). What is the Yule-Walker estimate for \\(\\mathbf{\\phi}\\) and also for \\(\\sigma\\)? 3.6 ARMA An autoregressive moving average, or ARMA(p,q), model is written as \\[ x_t = \\phi_1 x_{t-1} + \\dots + \\phi_p x_{t-p} + w_t + \\theta_1 w_{t-1} + \\dots + \\theta_q w_{t-q} \\] We can write an ARMA(p,q) model using the backshift operator \\[ \\phi_p (\\mathbf{B}^p) x_t= \\theta_q (\\mathbf{B}^q) w_t \\] ARMA models are stationary if all roots of \\(\\phi_p (\\mathbf{B}) &gt; 1\\) ARMA models are invertible if all roots of \\(\\theta_q (\\mathbf{B}) &gt; 1\\) 3.7 Lab 2 Simulate data from an AR(1) process in which \\(\\phi_1 = 0.6\\). For sample sizes \\(n=10,10^3,10^5\\), plot the difference between the theoretical autocorrelation and the observed (sample) autocorrelation for lags 1 through 20. What do you observe? Simulate data from the MA(3) model: \\(x_t = w_t+\\theta_1w_{t-1}+\\theta_2w_{t-2}+\\theta_3w_{t-3}\\) in which \\(\\theta = (0.7,0.6,0.2)\\). For sample sizes \\(n=10,10^3,10^5\\), plot the difference between the theoretical autocorrelation and the observed (sample) autocorrelation for lags 1 through 20. What do you observe? For an MA(1), \\(x_t = w_t + \\theta w_{t-1}\\) with \\(|\\theta|&lt;1\\), derive an expression for \\(\\phi_{22}\\).

Stationarity means ‘not changing in time’ in the context of time-series models. In a typical data analysis, however, we will not be assured that our data is stationary. Therefore, we need some methods to evaluate stationarity and also to deal with nonstationary data. We will discuss 2 common approaches to evaluating stationarity: Visual test Unit Root Test (ADF) 4.1.1 Visual Test The visual test is simply looking at a plot of the data versus time. Look for: Change in the level over time. Is the time series increasing or decreasing? Does it appear to cycle? Change in the variance over time. Do deviations away from the mean change over time, increase or decrease? 4.1.2 Unit Root Tests One of the most common forms of non-stationarity that is tested for is that the process has a random walk component, such as \\(x_t = x_{t-1} + e_t\\). A random walk is called a ‘unit root’ process in the time series literature since it occurs when one of the roots of the AR polynomial is 1. A test for an underlying random walk is called a ‘unit root’ test. 4.1.3 Dickey Fuller (DF) The DF tests for a unit root in the context of an AR(1) model, which can be written, \\[\\begin{align} x_t &amp;= \\phi_1 x_{t-1} + w_t \\\\ \\nabla x_t &amp;= (1-\\phi_1) x_{t-1} + w_t \\\\ &amp;= \\delta x_{t-1} + w_t \\end{align}\\] This model can be estimated, and testing for a unit root is equivalent to testing: \\[\\begin{align} H_0&amp;: \\delta = 0 \\\\ H_A&amp;: \\delta \\neq 0 \\end{align}\\] The test statistic has a specific distribution simply known as the Dickey–Fuller table, which is used to find the p-value. We want to reject the null hypothesis of non-stationarity. 4.1.4 Augmented DF The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test looks for evidence that an AR(p) process has a unit root (an underlying random walk process). The null hypothesis is that the time series has a unit root, that is, it has a random walk component. The alternative hypothesis is some variation of stationarity. The first difference, \\(\\nabla\\), of the general AR(p) model can be re-written as, \\[\\begin{align} \\nabla x_t = \\phi_1^\\prime x_{t-1} + \\sum_{i=1}^{p-1} \\phi_{i+1}^\\prime \\nabla x_{t-1} + w_t, \\end{align}\\] where \\[\\begin{align} \\phi_1^\\prime &amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^{p-1} \\phi_{i+1}^\\prime \\nabla x_{t-1} \\\\ \\phi_j^\\prime &amp;= \\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\phi_{j}~\\text{ for} j \\geq 2 \\end{align}\\] Our interest is on \\(\\phi_1^\\prime\\) since it is equal to 0 exactly when 1 is a root of the AR(p) polynomial. Therefore, the hypothesis test is, \\[\\begin{align} H_0&amp;: \\phi_1^\\prime = 0 \\\\ H_A&amp;: \\phi_1^\\prime \\neq 0 \\end{align}\\] ## ## Attaching package: &#39;reshape2&#39; ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:tidyr&#39;: ## ## smiths 4.2 ADF test using tseries::adf.test() adf.test() in the tseries package will apply the Augmented Dickey-Fuller with a constant and trend and report the p-value. We want to reject the Dickey=Fuller null hypothesis of non-stationarity. We will set k=0 to apply the Dickey-Fuller test which tests for AR(1) stationarity. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests for more general lag-p stationarity. adf.test(x, alternative = c(&quot;stationary&quot;, &quot;explosive&quot;), k = trunc((length(x)-1)^(1/3))) 4.3 ARIMA Models Our data is not always stationary. If the data do not appear stationary, differencing can help. This leads to the class of autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. ARIMA models are indexed with orders (p,d,q) where d indicates the order of differencing. \\(\\{x_t\\}\\) follows an ARIMA(p,d,q) process if \\((1-\\mathbf{B})^d x_t\\) is an ARMA(p,q) process. For example, if we look at Japan exports over the time period from 1960 to 2016, we see a clear evolution in the mean of the time series, indicating that the time series is not stationary. je = global_economy %&gt;% filter(Country == &quot;Japan&quot;, Year&lt; 2017) %&gt;% mutate(d = c(NA, diff(Exports))) As we saw in week one, if we instead look at the year over year changes in exports, we see something that more closely resembles a stationary time series. 4.3.1 Model Selection/ Fitting The general sequence of steps involved in fitting an ARIMA model to a given time series are: Evaluate whether the time series is stationary If not, make it stationary - select the differencing level (d) Select the AR level (p) and the MA level (q) that optimize the AIC Steps two and three are automated with the function forecast::auto.arima function. For instance, m0 = auto.arima(je$Exports) summary(m0) ## Series: je$Exports ## ARIMA(0,1,0) ## ## sigma^2 = 1.628: log likelihood = -93.1 ## AIC=188.21 AICc=188.28 BIC=190.24 ## ## Training set error measures: ## ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ## Training set 0.0948585 1.264655 0.883942 0.2186117 7.269751 0.9826653 ## ACF1 ## Training set -0.04317139 4.3.2 Model Checking 4.3.2.1 Check the residuals Residuals = difference between the observations (data), \\(y\\), and expected (fitted) values, \\(\\hat{y}\\). Thus, the i’th residual is: \\(y_i-\\hat{y}_i\\). In R, we can obtain the vector of residuals using the residuals function, as shown below. 4.3.2.2 residuals() function in R The residuals() function will return the residuals for fitted models. ## Time Series: ## Start = 1 ## End = 57 ## Frequency = 1 ## [1] 0.01072294 -1.44501952 0.15303390 -0.39309669 0.45625211 1.02356255 ## [7] 0.06053730 -0.92437932 0.45807416 0.44426518 -0.19594755 0.86880508 ## [13] -1.08192227 -0.52480724 3.41625812 -0.76990990 0.72818035 -0.44252813 ## [19] -1.89419993 0.42955074 2.03742971 0.99396401 -0.20034080 -0.62338421 ## [25] 1.09590411 -0.50007152 -2.98081554 -0.97493052 -0.36290393 0.53728879 ## [31] 0.10797014 -0.43368768 -0.09399316 -0.61422391 -0.07420507 -0.03185334 ## [37] 0.50727239 1.06978245 -0.02437143 -0.57272023 0.67272500 -0.39538586 ## [43] 0.78912188 0.62107244 1.33273884 1.04040881 1.86046117 1.62041428 ## [49] -0.06927885 -4.90312357 2.51584283 -0.11176077 -0.38024365 1.37064557 ## [55] 1.62490343 0.04862657 -1.46977556 To check the fit of our model, we want to check that the residuals are white noise. 4.3.3 Forecasting 4.3.3.1 Point Estimates The basic idea of forecasting with an ARIMA model is to estimate the parameters and forecast forward. For example, let’s say we want to forecast with a ARIMA(2,1,0) model with drift: \\[z_t = \\mu + \\beta_1 z_{t-1} + \\beta_2 z_{t-2} + e_t\\] where \\(z_t = x_t - x_{t-1}\\), the first difference. Arima() would write this model: \\[(z_t-m) = \\beta_1 (z_{t-1}-m) + \\beta_2 (z_{t-2}-m) + e_t\\] The relationship between \\(\\mu\\) and \\(m\\) is \\(\\mu = m(1 - \\beta_1 - \\beta_2)\\). Let’s estimate the \\(\\beta\\)’s for this model from Japan export. ## ar1 ar2 drift ## -0.05580519 -0.18850080 0.10736838 ## drift ## 0.1335991 So we can forecast with this model: \\[z_t = 0.1335991 -0.05580519 z_{t-1} - 0.18850080 z_{t-2} + e_t\\] To obtain the \\(T+1\\) forecast value: zt_1 = 16.119153 - 17.588928 zt_2 = 17.588928 - 17.540302 16.119153 + (0.1335991 - 0.05580519 * zt_1 - 0.18850080 * zt_2) ## [1] 16.32561 4.3.3.2 Standard Errors To obtain the standard errors of the model forecast, it is helpful to reformulate the ARIMA model as an infinite order MA model. Any ARIMA model can be written as an infinite order MA model: \\[\\begin{align} x_t - \\mu &amp;= w_t + \\psi_1 w_{t-1} + \\psi_2 w_{t-1} + \\ldots + \\psi_k w_{t-k} + \\ldots \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{j=0}^\\infty \\psi_j w_{t-j} \\text{ where } \\psi_0=1 \\end{align}\\] For example, the AR(1) model: \\[\\begin{align} y_t &amp;= \\phi y_{t-1} + w_t \\\\ &amp;= \\phi ( \\phi y_{t-1} + w_{t-1} ) + w_t \\\\ &amp;= \\phi^2 y_{t-1} + \\phi w_{t-1} + w_t \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\phi^j w_{t-j} \\end{align}\\] The standard deviation of the forecast error at time \\(T+h\\) is, \\[\\begin{align} \\sqrt{ \\hat{\\sigma}^2_w \\sum_{j=0}^{h-1} \\psi_j^2 } \\end{align}\\] With the assumption of normally distributed errors, a 95% prediction interval for \\(x_{T+h}\\) is, \\[\\begin{align} \\hat{x}_{T+h} \\pm 1.96 \\sqrt{ \\hat{\\sigma}^2_w \\sum_{j=0}^{h-1} \\psi_j^2 } \\end{align}\\] For example, the one step ahead forecast for the Japan Export model has a 95% prediction interval: c(16.32561 - qnorm(.975) * sqrt(1.645), 16.32561 + qnorm(.975) * sqrt(1.645)) ## [1] 13.81181 18.83941 You can also use the forecast function to obtain point estimates and prediction intervals. For example, fr = forecast(fit, h = 5) plot(fr) 4.4 SARIMA 4.5 Lab 3 Consider fpp3::aus_airpassengers, the total number of passengers (in millions) from Australian air carriers for the period 1970-2011. Use forecast::auto.arima() to find an appropriate ARIMA model. What model was selected? Write the model in terms of the backshift operator. Check that the residuals look like white noise. Plot forecasts for the next 10 periods. Plot forecasts from an ARIMA(0,1,0) model with drift and compare these to the automatically selected model. Choose an employment type from fpp3::us_employment, the total employment in different industries in the United States. Are the data stationary? If not, find an appropriate transformation which yields stationary data. Examine ACF and PACF plots of the transformed data (if this was necessary to attain stationarity) to identify a couple of ARIMA models that might be useful in describing the time series. Which of your models is the best according to their AIC values? Estimate the parameters of your best model and do diagnostic testing on the residuals. Do the residuals resemble white noise? If not, try to find another ARIMA model which fits better. Forecast the next 3 years of data. Get the latest figures from https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/11 to check the accuracy of your forecasts. Eventually, the prediction intervals are so wide that the forecasts are not particularly useful. How many years of forecasts do you think are sufficiently accurate to be usable? Another way that a time series may violate stationarity is with seasonality. For example, the Leisure and Hospitality sector of the economy spikes in the summer and dips in the winter months. We will look at employment (in thousands) in this sector since 2010: leisure = fpp3::us_employment %&gt;% filter(Title == &quot;Leisure and Hospitality&quot;, year(Month) &gt;= 2010) %&gt;% select(Month, Employed) Make a plot of this time series and comment on the trend and the seasonality. Find appropriate transformation(s) to make the time series stationary. What were the transformations? Provide any necessary plots to validate stationarity. Use auto.arima to fit an ARIMA model to the data. You can use either the original time series or the transformed time series. In either case, you may find it helpful to coerce your input time series into a time series object with frequency 12. This will ensure that the function explores seasonal parameters and transformations in the fitting process. What model was selected? Use forecast to forecast the next twelve months of data. Plot the forecast along with the orginal time series. Does the model capture the trend and seasonality?
