Answer the following 5 questions for these 2 datasets:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# dataset 1: Johnson and Johnson quarterly earnings.
y1 = JohnsonJohnson

# dataset 2: weekly unemployment claims data
df2 = read.csv("https://tinyurl.com/2r89cbj4")[,c('date', 'value')]
```


1. Plot the data. Are the data stationary? Why not? If not, find an appropriate transformation which yields approximately stationary data.

2. Plot the ACF and PACF of the transformed time series. What are one or two candidate models based on these plots?

3. Use forecast::auto.arima() to find an optimized ARIMA model. Use the original (i.e., nonstationary) time series as the input. What model was selected? Write the fit model equation.

4. Comment on the residuals from the model fit in question 3.

5. Plot forecasts from the model fit in question 3 for the next 10 periods.
